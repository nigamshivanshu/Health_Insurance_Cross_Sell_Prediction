Health Insurance Cross Sell Prediction
Project Description
Introduction
The Health Insurance Cross Sell Prediction project is designed to empower insurance companies in refining their cross-selling strategies. The primary objective is to identify potential customers within the existing health insurance clientele who are likely to convert and purchase vehicle insurance. Cross-selling is a pivotal strategy for insurance companies to not only maximize revenue but also to enhance customer retention. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and thorough analysis of a comprehensive dataset, this project seeks to build a predictive model capable of accurately identifying customers with a higher likelihood of showing interest in purchasing vehicle insurance.

Dataset Overview
The dataset encompasses a diverse set of features related to customers, providing invaluable insights into their characteristics and behaviors. These features include:

Customer ID: A unique identifier for each customer.
Gender: The gender of the customer.
Age: The age of the customer.
Driving License Status: Indicates whether the customer holds a valid driving license.
Region Code: Code representing the geographical region of the customer.

Vintage: The number of days the customer has been associated with the insurance company.
Customer Response: The target variable, indicating the customer's interest in vehicle insurance.
Each feature within the dataset holds crucial information that will be utilized to develop a robust predictive model. The goal is to create a model that not only accurately predicts customer response but also provides actionable insights for insurance companies to optimize their cross-selling strategies.
