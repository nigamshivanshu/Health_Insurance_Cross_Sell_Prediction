## Project Description
---
### Introduction:-

The **Health Insurance Cross Sell Prediction** project is designed to empower insurance companies in refining their cross-selling strategies. The primary objective is to identify potential customers within the existing health insurance clientele who are likely to convert and purchase vehicle insurance. Cross-selling is a pivotal strategy for insurance companies to not only maximize revenue but also to enhance customer retention. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and thorough analysis of a comprehensive dataset, this project seeks to build a predictive model capable of accurately identifying customers with a higher likelihood of showing interest in purchasing vehicle insurance.
